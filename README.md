## word Count Java Program

This Java program takes user input of a text string, removes extra whitespace, and counts the number of words in the string. It ensures the validity of the input and handles cases of multiple consecutive spaces. The word count functionality is implemented using a simple loop to iterate through the array of words. This program can serve as a basic utility for text processing tasks.
